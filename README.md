Experiences and Strengths 

In this course I built and deployed a full stack web application in the cloud. I learned how to use Docker, Docker Compose, and REST APIs, and I gained a better understanding of microservices and serverless. These skills make me stronger as a candidate for IT and software development jobs. 

My strengths as a developer are problem solving, adapting to new tools, and working well with others. I can explain technical ideas clearly and handle challenges under pressure. I am ready for roles like IT support specialist, system support technician, or junior developer. 

 

Planning for Growth 

Cloud services make it possible to grow an application without buying new hardware. Microservices let each part of the app be managed separately, while serverless lets me pay only for the functions that run. 

To handle more traffic, I would use load balancing and auto-scaling. For errors, I would add retries, monitoring, and logging. Costs can be tracked with cloud budgets and alerts. Serverless is usually more predictable for cost, while containers give more control but can be harder to manage. 

Elasticity and pay-for-service are key for growth. Elasticity makes sure resources scale up or down as needed, and pay-for-service means I only pay for what I use. This keeps costs low and allows the application to grow smoothly.
